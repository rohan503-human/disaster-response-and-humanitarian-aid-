here we are seeing how can we detect , predict and act when there is a disaster .
detection we have data of different weather peremeters , from there we will create a threashold for each . if a peremeter crocesses a threashold it will be given a point
and if multiple peremeters hit threshold all points will be added . and if the points are above the limit type of allert will be given to closest search and rescue teams.
or command and control centers . 
and in the graphs there is different types of peremeters in y axis and date in x axis .
